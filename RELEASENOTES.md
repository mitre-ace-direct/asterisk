Release Candidate: v2.1.0-RC

This version of Asterisk has been undergoing QA Tests with the NTL starting 09 May 2018. It has not received any major updates to configurations or dialplans but has recently been provisioned with a new res_pjsip_session.c patch which addresses the issue with the missing H264 fmtp attribute on outbound calls as well as performing a conditional check so that this is not applied during webRTC - webRTC (VP8) calls through Asterisk.
