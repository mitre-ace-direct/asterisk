     Notes from GovCloud Install
========================================
* IPV6 error - cat on file which did not exist
* I believe we disabeled it on the OS to resolve (might commented out the code though)
* Need to make sure the user set the hostname ahead of time otherwise the script will error out
* /etc/environment needs to be setup for the proxy 
* this needs to be executed within the script or in bashrc profile
* Additional installs we had to perform:
	- patch
	- sqlite
